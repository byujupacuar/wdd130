            <p>Hello!, my name es Pablo Cuiza i am 44 years old, from La Paz Bolivia, i am marriege 24 year ago, 
                i have 6 children, i like wathc mivies with my family, 
                super heros movieas are my fovorites, i like food, play basketball and computer stuff.
                I am a person with strong ethics and moral values. I have a strong collaborative spirit, 
                am a team player, and am prepared to work under pressure. I am helpful and committed to the company's goals. 
                My oldest son, Erik, served a mission in Curtiba, Brazil. He was there for two years, serving the Lord, preaching the gospel, and teaching people about charity, love, and forgiveness. I'm very proud of him; he's a good man.
                My youngest son, Matias, has a neurological condition called ASD and ADHD. He's a happy and very intelligent boy. He loves letters and numbers.
                My daughter Megan is a natural athlete. She can play any sport and dances very well. She is very intelligent and sociable. She loves animals, especially insects.
                Nate is 11 years old. He is very sensitive. He likes to play Brawl Stars and football. He cares a lot about others and makes friends. He is very temperamental.
                Ryan is my little one. He is very intelligent and likes to follow the rules. He is a good artist. He gets angry very quickly because not everyone follows the rules. He is so intelligent for his age that it surprises me. He is independent.
                And finally, Mafer. She is my first daughter. She taught me how to be a father. I love her so much. She has infinite potential. She has everything to succeed. She is so strong and brave that even she doesn't know how much she is. 
                She cares so much for her siblings. They don't know how lucky they are to have an older sister like her.</p>
